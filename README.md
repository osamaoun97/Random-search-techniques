## Introduction

This project aims to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using three different algorithms: Nearest Neighbor (NN) Algorithm, Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Ant Colony Algorithm (ACA). The TSP is a classic optimization problem that involves finding the shortest possible route for a salesman to visit a given set of cities and return to the starting point. By applying these algorithms, we can find efficient solutions to the TSP.

## Problem Statement

The TSP requires finding the optimal route that visits all cities exactly once and returns to the starting city. This problem is known to be NP-hard, meaning that it becomes increasingly difficult to find the optimal solution as the number of cities increases. The goal of this project is to use the NN, GA, and ACA algorithms to approximate or find near-optimal solutions for the TSP.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies are used in this project:

- Python: Programming language used to implement the algorithms.
- Sklearn: Deep learning framework for implementing the ml algorithms.
- NumPy: Library for numerical computations.
- Matplotlib: Library for data visualization.

## Algorithms

1. **Nearest Neighbor (NN) Algorithm:** The NN algorithm is a heuristic approach that starts with an arbitrary city and repeatedly selects the nearest unvisited city as the next destination. This process continues until all cities have been visited, and the salesman returns to the starting city. Although it does not guarantee an optimal solution, the NN algorithm is simple and provides a good approximation for many TSP instances.

2. **Genetic Algorithm (GA):** The GA is an evolutionary algorithm that imitates the process of natural selection. It starts with a population of potential solutions and evolves them over generations through selection, crossover, and mutation operations. The fittest individuals survive and reproduce to produce better solutions. In the context of the TSP, the GA creates and evolves routes until an optimal or near-optimal solution is found.

3. **Ant Colony Algorithm (ACA):** The ACA is inspired by the behavior of ants searching for food. It involves simulating a population of artificial ants that move through the TSP graph, depositing pheromone trails and following them. The pheromone trails guide the ants to explore promising routes. Over time, the pheromone trails are reinforced, and the ants converge on a good solution. The ACA is particularly effective for solving TSP problems with large numbers of cities.
